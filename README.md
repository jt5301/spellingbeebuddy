# Spelling Bee Buddy

https://spellingbeebuddy.herokuapp.com/


A buddy to help you solve the New York Times' Spelling Bee. This web app was essentially made possible using two leetcode-style algorithms: Find all subsequences of a string, and find all permutations of a string.

There's still a few things I'd like to refactor, but it's currently in a state where it can be used! Just download, npm install and start, or go to the hosted site above. I've personally been testing it on most days using The NYT's online spelling bee.
